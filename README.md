The purpose of this project is to analyze the CCM Computing Courses Entry Surveys, which are administered every Fall semester to entry level computing 
classes and computer literacy courses by the Information Technologies Department. Using the provided survey datasets, I will focus on data regarding 
non majors in order to assist the Information Technologies department in increasing their enrollment rates for computing classes. This analysis will 
allow the Information Technologies department to determine why non major students are currently enrolled in computing classes and provide them with 
data driven answers on how and where they should focus their recruitment efforts in order to ultimitly increase enrollment for non majors. Over the 
course of this project I will successfully determine data science questions that will be answered using the given dataset, clean the dataset using 
different tools in order to prepare it for analysis, and successfully analyze and visualize the data in order to answer my original questions.
